Progressive frontend developer ⚡ specializing in building (and occasionally designing) websites and applications.

As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design — combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. 

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably reading, cruising around places, watching movies or crossing off another item on my bucket list 🤔.
